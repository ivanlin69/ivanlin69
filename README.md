## Hi, my name is Ivan Lin ðŸ¦Œ

In 2022, I began my programming journey in graduate schoolðŸŽ“ and quickly became captivated by the world of coding. Although I found it challenging, the process was incredibly rewarding and brought me a lot of joy. I started by learning `C`, `Java`, and `Python`, but my passion truly lies with `C/C++`. I appreciate C/C++ for its unique blend of low-level control and powerful capabilities, which makes it a compelling language for me to work with.

## My work

### ðŸ“š **Book Database System**
A `C` program offers robust functionalities for managing book information, including adding, removing, updating, and listing books in a database. It ensures data integrity through meticulous creation and validation of the database file header.

It leverags the getopt library to provide an intuitive Unix command line interface, allowing users to perform various operations seamlessly, and the modular design ensures maintainability and scalability.

### âš“ **Sea Battle Solo**
A classic single-player Sea Battle game implemented in `C++`. Features include customizable grid sizes, variable ship numbers, random ship placement, and detailed gameplay statistics.

It's optimized for multiple standards(Pre-C++11, C++11, and C++17), the game leverages advanced design principles such as design patterns and polymorphism. The modular and plug-and-play architecture ensures easy customization and extension.


### ðŸ¤– **Sudoku Solver**
A `C++` application that automates solving Sudoku puzzles using algorithmic techniques such as the `AC-3` algorithm for arc consistency and a `backtracking` method for complex/hard puzzles, enhanced by the Minimum Remaining Values heuristic.

The solver showcases the realization and application of data structures and algorithms, achieving high efficiency with most puzzles solved within 1 second.
