## Hi, my name is Ivan Lin ðŸ¦Œ

In 2022, I began my programming journey in graduate schoolðŸŽ“ and quickly became captivated by the world of coding. Although I found it challenging, the process was incredibly rewarding and brought me a lot of joy. I started by learning `C`, `Java`, and `Python`, but my passion truly lies with `C/C++`. I appreciate C/C++ for its unique blend of low-level control and powerful capabilities, which makes it a compelling language for me to work with.

## My work

### ðŸ“š **Book Database System**
A `C` program that supports network operations, allowing remote clients to interact with the server to manage book information in a database. It ensures data integrity through careful validation of the database header and employs a custom protocol for reliable communication.

It leverages the getopt library for an intuitive Unix command line interface, and utilizes multiplexing and finite state machines for effective state management.

### âš“ **Sea Battle Solo**
A classic single-player Sea Battle game implemented in `C++`. Features include customizable grid sizes, variable ship numbers, random ship placement, and detailed gameplay statistics.

It's optimized for multiple standards(Pre-C++11, C++11, and C++17), the game leverages advanced design principles such as design patterns and polymorphism. The modular and plug-and-play architecture ensures easy customization and extension.


### ðŸ¤– **Sudoku Solver**
A `C++` application that automates solving Sudoku puzzles using algorithmic techniques such as the `AC-3` algorithm for arc consistency and a `backtracking` method for complex/hard puzzles, enhanced by the Minimum Remaining Values heuristic.

The solver showcases the realization and application of data structures and algorithms, achieving high efficiency with most puzzles solved within 1 second.
