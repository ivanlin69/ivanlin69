## Hi, my name is Ivan Lin ü¶å

In 2022, I began my programming journey in graduate schoolüéì and quickly became captivated by the world of coding. Although I found it challenging, the process was incredibly rewarding and brought me a lot of joy. I started by learning `C`, `Java`, and `Python`, but my passion truly lies with `C` and `Assembly`, and I appreciate for their unique blend of low-level control and powerful capabilities.

## My work

### üìö **[Book Database System](https://github.com/ivanlin69/BookDBSystem)**
A `C` program that supports `network` operations, allowing remote clients to interact with the server to manage book information in a `database`. It ensures data integrity through careful validation of the database header and employs a custom protocol for reliable communication.

It leverages the getopt library for an intuitive Unix command line interface, and utilizes multiplexing and finite state machines for effective state management.

### üõ†Ô∏è **[Mini Shell with ARM](https://github.com/ivanlin69/miniShell)
A simple shell program for ARM 32-bit architecture, written in ARM assembly language and designed to work under a Linux environment. The shell reads user input, parses commands and arguments, forks child processes to execute commands using execve, and waits for the child processes to complete.

### ‚öì **[Sea Battle Solo](https://github.com/ivanlin69/SeaBattleSolo)**
A classic single-player Sea Battle game implemented in `C++`. Features include customizable grid sizes, variable ship numbers, random ship placement, and detailed gameplay statistics.

It's optimized for multiple standards(Pre-C++11, C++11, and C++17), the game leverages advanced design principles such as design patterns and polymorphism. The modular and plug-and-play architecture ensures easy customization and extension.


### ü§ñ **[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/ivanlin69/SudokuSolver)**
A `C++` application that automates solving Sudoku puzzles using algorithmic techniques such as the `AC-3` algorithm for arc consistency and a `backtracking` method for complex/hard puzzles, enhanced by the Minimum Remaining Values heuristic.

The solver showcases the realization and application of data structures and algorithms, achieving high efficiency with most puzzles solved within 1 second.
